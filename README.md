#### I used this product to learn more about UI problems, this was very useful to be able to build uStock a large-scale project I started a few months later.

##### I truly believe apple's design principles are unmatched in their simplicity and beauty. It is a testament to how much art and expression is actually a huge part of a winning project like Apple's operating systems were.
